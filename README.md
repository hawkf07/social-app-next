## How do I deploy this?

### Vercel

We recommend deploying to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/?utm_source=t3-oss&utm_campaign=oss). It makes it super easy to deploy NextJs apps.

- Push your code to a GitHub repository.
- Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/?utm_source=t3-oss&utm_campaign=oss) and sign up with GitHub.
- Create a Project and import the repository you pushed your code to.
- Add your environment variables.
- Click **Deploy**
- Now whenever you push a change to your repository, Vercel will automatically redeploy your website!

### Docker

You can also dockerize this stack and deploy a container. See the [Docker deployment page](https://create-t3-app-nu.vercel.app/en/deployment/docker) for details.
